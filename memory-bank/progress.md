# Project Progress

## What Works
- The project has been initialized with the necessary development environment
- Memory bank files have been set up with project requirements and context
- Chrome extension files have been created:
  - manifest.json
  - background.js
  - content.js
- The functionality to copy URL and title in Markdown format has been implemented
- Keyboard shortcuts have been configured
- Flash message functionality has been implemented to display copied content in the browser

## What's Left to Build
- Nothing major left to build, the core functionality is complete

## Current Status
- Chrome extension implementation is complete
- The extension is ready for testing
- The extension should be able to copy the current URL and page title in Markdown format to the clipboard when the Ctrl+I (or Cmd+I on macOS) shortcut is pressed
- A flash message will appear in the browser to confirm that the content has been copied
- For tabs that were already open before the extension was loaded, a notification will appear to inform the user to reload the tab

## Known Issues
- ✅ Fixed: ReferenceError: document is not defined in background.js - Replaced DOM manipulation with Clipboard API for clipboard operations
- ✅ Fixed: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'writeText') - Moved clipboard operations from background script to content script with fallback method
- ✅ Fixed: Shortcut key conflict with standard browser shortcuts - Changed from Ctrl+C to Ctrl+I to avoid conflicts
- ✅ Fixed: "Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist." error - Added notification to inform users to reload the tab
- ✅ Fixed: "Unable to download all specified images" error - Replaced data URL with an actual icon file

## How to Test the Extension
1. Load the extension in Chrome:
   - Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/
   - Enable "Developer mode" in the top right
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the `src` directory
2. Navigate to a web page
3. Press Ctrl+I (Windows) or Cmd+I (macOS) to copy the URL and title in Markdown format
4. Paste the copied text into a text editor to verify the format: `[<page title>](<page URL>)`
